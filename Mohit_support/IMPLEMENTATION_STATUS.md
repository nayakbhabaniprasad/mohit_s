# Fraud Risk Scanner - Implementation Status Report

## Executive Summary

**Current Status**: The project is a **STUB IMPLEMENTATION** with basic infrastructure but **NO ACTUAL FUNCTIONALITY**.

All three components (Alert Bridge, Feeder, Scanner) are placeholder applications that start successfully but perform no work.

## What We Have ✅

- ✅ Proper Maven project structure
- ✅ Java 21 compliance
- ✅ Three separate components (Alert Bridge, Feeder, Scanner)
- ✅ Executable JARs built with Maven Shade plugin
- ✅ Basic logging with SLF4J/Logback
- ✅ Test structure in place
- ✅ Habitat configuration files
- ✅ Jenkins pipeline configured

## What's Missing ❌

### Critical Gaps

1. **No Hazelcast Integration** (Feeder)
   - Required for cluster coordination
   - Required for semaphore logic
   - Prevents duplicate processing

2. **No Directory Monitoring** (Feeder)
   - Cannot detect new reports from NGFT
   - No file discovery mechanism

3. **No ServiceLoader Pattern** (Scanner)
   - Cannot dynamically load scanners
   - Cannot support multiple report types
   - Missing core architecture

4. **No Risk Routing** (Alert Bridge)
   - Cannot send alerts to Splunk/Netcool
   - No routing decision logic

5. **No File Processing** (All)
   - Cannot read report files
   - Cannot parse text reports
   - Cannot detect patterns
   - Cannot generate risks

6. **No Configuration Support**
   - Cannot read TOML files
   - No runtime configuration
   - Hard-coded values everywhere

## Code Comparison

### Current Implementation (Stub)
```java
public class FeederApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        logger.info("Starting Feeder Application - Stub Implementation");
        // Does nothing
        Thread.sleep(Long.MAX_VALUE);
    }
}
```

### Required Implementation (Based on Confluence)
```java
public class FeederApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // 1. Load configuration from .toml files
        FeederConfig config = loadConfig();
        
        // 2. Connect to Hazelcast cluster
        HazelcastInstance hz = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
        HazelcastSemaphoreManager semaphore = new HazelcastSemaphoreManager(hz);
        
        // 3. Start directory monitoring
        DirectoryMonitor monitor = new DirectoryMonitor(config.getSourceDir());
        
        // 4. Main loop: monitor, process, route
        while (running) {
            File report = monitor.getNextReport();
            
            // 5. Check semaphore (single processing)
            if (semaphore.tryAcquire(report)) {
                // 6. Invoke scanner
                int exitCode = invokeScanner(report);
                
                // 7. Handle result
                if (exitCode == 0) {
                    moveToSuccess(report);
                } else {
                    moveToError(report);
                }
            } else {
                // 8. Already processed by another node
                moveToSkip(report);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Recommendation

**This project needs significant development to meet requirements.**

### Option 1: Continue Development (Recommended)
- Implement all missing functionality
- Timeline: 8-12 weeks
- Effort: Full development cycle

### Option 2: Keep as Stub
- Keep current implementation
- Suitable only for POC/testing environment
- Cannot be used in production

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate** (Week 1)
   - Add Hazelcast dependency to Feeder
   - Create Risk model (shared)
   - Create TextReportScanner interface

2. **Short-term** (Week 2-4)
   - Implement directory monitoring
   - Implement semaphore logic
   - Implement ServiceLoader pattern

3. **Mid-term** (Week 5-8)
   - Implement file parsing
   - Implement risk detection
   - Implement routing logic
   - Add integration tests

4. **Long-term** (Week 9+)
   - Production hardening
   - Performance optimization
   - Comprehensive testing
   - Documentation

## Conclusion

The current implementation provides a **solid foundation** but requires **substantial development** to implement the architecture and functionality described in the Confluence documentation.

**Status**: Ready for development, not ready for production use.
